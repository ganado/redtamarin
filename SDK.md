## Introduction ##

The RedTamarin SDK is what a developer need to install to be able to work with the different redtamarin tools and libraries.

The SDK provides:
  * **redshell** AS3 command line runtimes
  * **redbean** AS3 make and compiler tools
  * **as3distro** AS3 package manager

At the contrary of Java we don't make differences between a JDK (Java Development Kit) and a SDK (Software Development Kit), we have only one SDK for everyone.
